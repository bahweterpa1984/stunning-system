Configuring Quicken Settings After Your Membership Ends
-------------------------------------------------------

After your membership has expired, it’s possible to keep using Quicken, but some configurations are necessary for optimal performance. Follow these steps to set up your software properly.

Firstly, check if your current version of Quicken is up to date. You may need to install the latest patch or release, specifically the r58.14 update, to ensure your software functions smoothly after expiration. This update can help fix bugs and improve overall stability.

To check for updates, navigate to the **Help** menu and select **Check for Updates**. Install any available updates to keep your software functioning properly. If necessary, restart Quicken after installing updates.

Next, configure your settings by going to the **Edit** menu, then select **Preferences**.
